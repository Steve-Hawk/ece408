# List Reduction

## Objective

Implement a kernel and associated host code that performs reduction of a 1D list stored in a C array. The reduction should give the sum of the list. You should implement the improved kernel discussed in the lecture. Your kernel should be able to handle input lists of arbitrary length.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, make sure that:

- You have completed week 4 lecture videos

## Instruction

For simplicity, you can assume that the input list will contain at most 2048 x 65535 elements so that it can be handled by only one kernel launch. The boundary condition can be handled by filling 'identity value (0 for sum)' into the shared memory of the last block when the length is not a multiple of the thread block size. Write a host (CPU) loop to calculate the total of the reduction sums of each section generated by individual blocks.

Edit the code in the `Code` tab to perform the following:

- allocate device memory
- copy host memory to device
- initialize thread block and kernel grid dimensions
- invoke CUDA kernel
- copy results from device to host
- deallocate device memory
- implement the improved reduction kernel
- use shared memory to reduce the number of global accesses, handle the boundary conditions when loading input list elements into the shared memory
- implement a CPU loop to perform final reduction based on the sums of sections generated by the thread blocks after copying the partial sum array back to the host memory

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is demarcated by the `//@@` comment lines.

## Suggestions

- The system's autosave feature is not an excuse to not backup your code and answers to your questions regularly.
- If you have not done so already, watch the tutorial videos.
- Do not modify the template code provided -- only insert code where the `//@@` demarcation is placed
- Develop your solution incrementally and test each version thoroughly before moving on to the next version
- Do not wait until the last minute to attempt the lab.
- If you get stuck with boundary conditions, grab a pen and paper. It is much easier to figure out the boundary conditions there.
- Implement the serial CPU version first, this will give you an understanding of the loops
- Get the first dataset working first. The datasets are ordered so the first one is the easiest to handle
- Make sure that your algorithm handles non-regular dimensional inputs (not square or multiples of 2). The slides may present the algorithm with nice inputs, since it minimizes the conditions. The datasets reflect different sizes of input that you are expected to handle
- Make sure that you test your program using all the datasets provided (the datasets can be selected using the dropdown next to the submission button)
- Check for errors: for example, when developing CUDA code, one can check for if the function call succeeded and print an error if not via the following macro:

    ```
    #define wbCheck(stmt) do {                                                    \
            cudaError_t err = stmt;                                               \
            if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                             \
                wbLog(ERROR, "Failed to run stmt ", #stmt);                       \
                wbLog(ERROR, "Got CUDA error ...  ", cudaGetErrorString(err));    \
                return -1;                                                        \
            }                                                                     \
        } while(0)
    ```

    An example usage is `wbCheck(cudaMalloc(...))`. A similar macro can be developed while programming OpenCL code.


## Local Development

While not required, the library used throughout the course can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/abduld/libwb). The library does not depend on any external library (and should be cross platform), you can use make to generate the shared object file (further instructions are found on the Github page). Linking against the library would allow you to get similar behavior to the web interface (minus the imposed limitations). Once linked against the library, you can launch your program as follows:

```
./program -e <expected_output_file> -i <input_file_1>,<input_file_2> -o <output_file> -t <type>
```

The `<expected_output_file>` and `<input_file_n>` are the input and output files provided in the dataset. The `<output_file>` is the location you'd like to place the output from your program. The `<type>` is the output file type: vector, matrix, or image. If an MP does not expect an input or output, then pass none as the parameter.

In case of issues or suggestions with the library, please report them through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/abduld/libwb/issues) on Github.
